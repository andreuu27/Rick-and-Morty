Understanding Arrow Functions in Your Characters Component
Arrow functions are a feature in modern JavaScript/TypeScript that provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. Let me explain the arrow function in your characters.component.ts file:
typescriptthis._filterService.searchText$.subscribe({
  next: (value: string) => {
    console.log(value);
  }
});
What This Arrow Function Does
This code subscribes to the searchText$ observable and defines what should happen when a new value arrives. The arrow function (value: string) => { console.log(value); } is the event handler for new values.
How Arrow Functions Work
Basic Syntax
An arrow function has this general form:
(parameters) => { statements }

Everything before the => defines the input parameters
Everything after the => defines what to do with those parameters

Breaking Down Your Example
typescript(value: string) => {
  console.log(value);
}

(value: string): This is the parameter list with one parameter named "value" that's typed as a string
=>: The "arrow" that separates parameters from function body
{ console.log(value); }: The function body that executes when the function is called

Compared to Traditional Functions
The same function written as a traditional function would look like:
typescriptfunction(value: string) {
  console.log(value);
}
Key Benefits of Arrow Functions in Your Context

More Concise: They require less code to write the same functionality.
Lexical this: Arrow functions don't have their own this context - they inherit this from the surrounding code. This is especially useful in class methods like your component.
Without an arrow function, you might have to do:
typescriptconst self = this;
this._filterService.searchText$.subscribe({
  next: function(value: string) {
    // 'this' would NOT reference the component here
    self.someComponentMethod(value);
  }
});
With an arrow function, this remains the component:
typescriptthis._filterService.searchText$.subscribe({
  next: (value: string) => {
    // 'this' still references the component
    this.someComponentMethod(value);
  }
});


In Your Observable Subscription Context
In your specific use case:

When new search text is emitted through the observable (searchText$)
The arrow function (value: string) => { console.log(value); } gets called
The parameter value contains the search text string that was emitted
The function body executes, logging that value to the console

If you wanted to do more with that value, you could expand the function body:
typescriptthis._filterService.searchText$.subscribe({
  next: (value: string) => {
    console.log(value);
    this.filterCharacters(value); // You could call a component method
    this.searchTerm = value; // You could update a component property
    // Any other processing you want to do with the search value
  }
});
Arrow functions are particularly useful for these callback scenarios where you're defining what should happen when an event occurs or when data arrives through an observable.
